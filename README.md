CS465 -Fullstack Development with MEAN
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
The SPA we developed for the projects was quite impressive. I enjoyed doing the simple Express HTML site, but the SPA site took it to another level. When I had it running it looked so much neater and like a 'real' website when it was running. 

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

MongoDB is a part of the MEAN stack. From a bit of research, I find that MongoDB and NoSQL are easier to understand and are more easily scalable than SQL databases.

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON is different from JS in that JSON is a format for the storage of data where JS is a programming language. JSON files can be used on the front and the back end, being parsed by Javascript programs to display and store data in the JSON format. 

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Reusable UI components make it easier to code an application as well as making the program run more efficiently if a computer only has to run the same piece of code over and over.  During the full stack process, I attempted to refactor code to make some of code more personalized (adding names, etc.). I think that was earlier on in the term. 

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Security funtions secure API endpoints. Endpoints are the communication channel of an API. Methods are the functions that implement these communication channels. 


How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This class taught me a lot of useful skills about web design and overall programming that I will hold with me throughtout my career going forward. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the various front and back end frameworks as well as JS, HTML, and CSS.
